    "description": "Rustbits are the main token of use within the Age of Rust game universe. You need Rustbits to not only play Age of Rust, but also to purchase in-game cryptoitems as well. Rustbits are radioactive rust scraped off of hulls of abandoned ships that are in orbit around a hidden planet, which is also a gas giant. The planet is so radioactive, it damages ships and kills anyone that gets close to it. Getting bits of rust off of ships is highly rare and prized.",
